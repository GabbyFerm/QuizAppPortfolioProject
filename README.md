# Music Quiz App
This is a simple console-based music quiz app that allows users to test their knowledge of music-related questions. The app loads a set of questions from a JSON file and presents them one by one to the user. For each question, the user selects an answer, and the app checks if it is correct.

The app provides:
- A colorful console interface with ASCII art for the quiz title.
- Multiple-choice questions with answers loaded from a JSON file.
- Real-time feedback on correct or incorrect answers.
- A final score display at the end of the quiz.

The core functionality includes:
- Loading questions from a JSON file.
- Asking questions and checking answers.
- Displaying results after the quiz ends.

The app uses libraries like Figgle for ASCII text rendering and Spectre.Console for styling and colorful output.
